# Introduction

## :trophy: A1.1 Learning Activity
Requirements Modeling through UML

### :blue_book: Instructions

* Based on the provided information by the teacher and other sources, develop the indicated diagrams in the development for the case study that has been reviewed during the subject.

* Use the same tools from past challenges, such as drawio, or others that allow you to create the
diagrams or images that can illustrate the concept.

* The team will explain what does this type of diagram represents, what elements are part of the diagram, as well as its interpretation within the case study.

* Every activity or challenge must be realized using **Markdown style with .md extension** and VSCode development environment, or another platform can be used, such as **Norton**, it has to be as a **single page** document, which means if the document has images, links o another external document it must be accesed from tags and links, and must be named using the nomenclature **A1.1_ActivityName_Student'sName.pdf.**

* As a requirement the .md file must contain a tag of the link to the repository of your Github document, for example a **Link to my GitHub** and after concluding the assignment it must be submitted to Github.

* From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** named with the nomenclature **A1.0_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf**, that must be uploaded to classroom in the corresponding section, serving as evidence of turned in, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the activity's result.

* Considering that the .pdf file was obtained from the .md file, both must be identical.

* Your repository, besides containing a **readme**.md inside the root directory containing student's information, team, subject, career, teacher's information, and also a logo or pictures, must contain a section of contents or index, which are **links to your md documents**, try not to use text to indicate internal or external links.

* It's suggested to use a structure similar to the one indicated below, however, you can use any other structure that can help you organize your repository.

## :pencil2: Development

1. Based on each one of the previously established user and system requirements for the study case, write the requested modeling diagrams:

* A diagram that contains the relationships between the different use cases, only for the scenario in which the user interacts with the system using the main or central functions according to each case study. (Include at least 5 elements of the diagram)

* The sequence diagram that explains the communication between the different GUIs for the use cases of the previous point, considering that the user has already successfully accessed the system. (Include at least 5 elements from the diagram)


* A class diagram for the objects that will be instanced, for the previously mentioned aspects (Include at least 5 elements of the diagram)


* A package diagram containing the component diagrams and the relationship between the database, user interfaces, controllers or intermediate layers - middleware (Include at least 3 diagram elements)


* The distribution diagrams representing the system's physical structure, such as networks, storage and web servers, firewall, mobile devices or any other physical resource that will be part of the system (include at least 3 elements of the diagram)
